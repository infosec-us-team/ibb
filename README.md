# Immunefi Bug Bounties (`ibb`)

**Effortlessly find and filter data on Immunefi Bug Bounty Programs**  
Is like [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) for Immunefi REST API. Search, filter and map structured data about bug bounty programs with easy. Pipe the output into other cli tools.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

List an array with all programs.
```sh
> ibb

["layerzero", "stargate", "sky", "sparklend", "reserve"...
```

Show details for a specific program
> ibb <program_name>

```sh
> ibb moonbeamnetwork

#...a JSON object with all details will be printed
```

Filter by fields (e.g., assets, URLs, documentation)
> ibb <program_name> <field> [<nested_field> ...]

```sh
> ibb moonbeamnetwork assets

[

    "addedAt": "2022-04-20T20:27:06.665Z",
    "description": "Blockchain - Moonbeam",
    "id": "5Uv4I8GXpfWeu9SX6b5Jhz",
    "isPrimacyOfImpact": null,
    "isSafeHarbor": null,
    "type": "blockchain_dlt",
    "url": "https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam"
  },
  #... more JSON objects here
```

```sh
> ibb moonbeamnetwork assets url

  "https://apps.moonbeam.network",
  "https://crowdloan.moonbeam.foundation/",
  "https://moonbeam.network/",
  "https://moonbeam.foundation/"
]
```

Find recursively any field returned by Immunefi's REST API for a specific Bug Bounty Program
> ibb [any_program] [any_field]

```sh
> ibb 0x programDocumentations

[
  {
    "createdAt": "2024-10-25T14:41:27.620Z",
    "description": "Program Documentation",
    "id": 51,
    "programId": 2249,
    "title": "0x Documentation",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-25T14:41:27.620Z",
    "url": "https://0x.org/docs/"
  },
  {
    "createdAt": "2024-10-25T14:43:28.812Z",
    "description": "Further Documentation",
    "id": 52,
    "programId": 2249,
    "title": "0x Documentation",
    "updatedAt": "2024-10-25T14:43:28.812Z",
    "url": "https://0x.org/docs/developer-resources/settler"
  }
]
```

Filter the output as much as desired by adding nested fields
> ibb [any_program] [any_field] [nestedfield_1] [nestedfield_2]

```sh
> ibb moonbeamnetwork bounty impacts title
